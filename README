This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Downloads the dataset from the link provided
2. Loads the activity and feature info
3. Loads both the training and test datasets
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
5. Names the activity_label names with appropriate activities in the dataset
6. Merges the two test and train dataset
7. Filters the columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
8. Converts the Activity, ActivityLabel and SubjectIdentifier columns into factors
9. Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names
10. Creates an independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
11. The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt
12. Creates a codebook for tidy.txt


Additional notes:

SubjectIdentifier - The ID of the subject
Activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

WALKING: subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING: subject was sitting during the test
